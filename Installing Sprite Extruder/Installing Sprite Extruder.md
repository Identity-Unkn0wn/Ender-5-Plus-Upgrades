# Installing Sprite Extruder
This is mostly self explanitory, but for the sake of flow I will add this section. For steps 1 and 2 I will not be adding photos as you can just reverse the steps you took while assembling your printer. [Manual](https://www.creality.com/pages/download-ender-5-plus)
>If you have not printed all of the parts please click [here](Printing%20Sprite%20Extruder%20Parts.md).

## Step 1
* Verify printer's power is off; unplug if you feel like it

## Step 2
* Remove original hotend. Save all wheel hardware and screws holding hotend to mounting plate. Follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbmqpncobn8) if you do not know how to do this.
* Loosen belt tensioner on the left side of the X-axis.

 > * Red - This will all be pulled off original 

## Step 4
