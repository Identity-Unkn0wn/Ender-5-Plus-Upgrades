# Printint Adapter Plate
I have created two variations of the mounting plate. The fist one is more of an adapter plate and second a mouinting system. BLUF if you can only print PLA & PETG [Adapter Plate](#adapter-plate) is what you want to go with. In my testing both my PLA and PETG [Mount](#mount) melted where the bottom wheel bolt head is, so use at your own risk!

## Adapter Plate

* Get [Adapter Plate](../Files/E5+%20Adapter%20Plate.stl)
* Print it
    * Print Settings:
        * Nozzle size 0.4 mm
        * Layer and inital Layer height: 0.2 mm
        * Line width: 0.48 mm
        * Wall line count: 5 (you can do less, just add infill)
        * Top/Bottom: 2 (done this way intentionnal)        
        * Print thin walls : ☑️
        * infill: 0% (won't need any with 5 walls)
        
> **Note:** Everything is really your prefrance, this is just what has worked for me. Outside of what I provided will be up to what you have your printer tuned for that printer and nozzle diameter.


## Mount

* Get [Mount](../Files/Ender5+%20Mount.stl)
* Print it
    * Print Settings:
        * Nozzle size 0.4 mm
        * Layer and inital Layer height: 0.2 mm
        * Line width: 0.48 mm
        * Wall line count: 5 (you can do more and have 0 infill)
        * Top/Bottom: 2 (done this way intentionally)
        * Alternate Extra wall: ☑️
        * Print thin walls : ☑️
        * infill: 50% (your descretion)
        * Infill Pattern: Gyroid (your descretion)
        * Supports: off (this depends on how much you trust your print settings/ tuning)
        
> **Note:** Everything is really your prefrance, this is just what has worked for me. Outside of what I provided will be up to what you have your printer tuned for that printer and nozzle diameter. **REMINDER:** This [Mount](#mount)  will melt if the filament used doesn't have a high temp threshold.

# Extruder Cable Mount
This next item is optional, if you have a better method you want to use go ahead, but the cable will drak on the Y-axis stepper motor and bars.

* Get Cable Mount parts [1](../Files/Extruder%20Cable%20Base.stl) & [2](../Files/Extruder%20Cable%20Top.stl)
    * Print Setting:
         * Nozzle size 0.4 mm
        * Layer and inital Layer height: 0.2 mm
        * Line width: 0.48 mm
        * Wall line count: 4 (my default)
        * Top/Bottom: 4 (my default)
        * Alternate Extra wall: ☑️
        * infill: 50% (your descretion)
        * Infill Pattern: Gyroid (your descretion)
        * Supports: off (this again depends on how much you trust your print settings)
