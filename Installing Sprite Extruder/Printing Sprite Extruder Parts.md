# Printint Adapter Plate
I have created two variations of the mounting plate. The fist one is more of an adapter plate and second a mouinting system. BLUF if you can only print PLA & PETG [Adapter Plate](#adapter-plate) is what you want to go with. In my testing both my PLA and PETG [Mount](#mount) melted where the bottom wheel bolt head is, so use at your own risk!

## Adapter Plate

* Get [Adapter Plate](Files/E5+%20Adapter%20Plate.stl)
* Print it
    * Print Settings:
        * Nozzle size 0.4 mm
        * Layer and inital Layer height: 0.2 mm
        * Line width: 0.48 mm
        * Wall line count: 5 (you can do less, just add infill)        
        * Print thin walls : ☑️
        * infill: 0% (won't need any with 5 walls)
        
> **Note:** Everything is really your prefrance, this is just what has worked for me. Outside of what I provided will be up to what you have your printer tuned for that printer and nozzle diameter.


## Mount

* Get [Mount](Files/Ender5+%20Mount.stl)
* Print it
    * Print Settings:
        * Nozzle size 0.4 mm

> **Note:** Everything is really your prefrance, this is just what has worked for me. Outside of what I provided will be up to what you have your printer tuned for that printer and nozzle diameter. **REMINDER:** This [Mount](#mount)  will melt if the filament used doesn't have a high temp threshold.
